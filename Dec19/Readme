Section 1.3 

We're resuming our SICP study in January starting from Ch2.  But for
those who are just joining us now, or who need a refresher, we're
running 2 sessions on Ch1 before the Christmas holidays.

Coding Dojo on Section 1.3

This week we're working through the third section of the first
chapter: Section 1.3: Higher Order Procedures
 http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_sec_1.3

Please read through it before coming. You may also wish to watch the
Video Lecture for this section.

Topics we're looking at:

* Passing procedures/functions as arguments

* Defining functions with lambda expressions

* Using lambda to create local variables (the let case)

* Describing general/abstract computations (exempli gratia accumulators)

* Functions that return functions.

Please remember to bring a laptop with racket
(http://racket-lang.org/) installed.
