Sec 2.2

Sec 2.2 introduces several "famous" functional idioms, including the
map and reduce function (the MapReduce algorithm is beyond the scope
of this study group, but it's inspired by this idea.)

[Never joined us before?  No worries!  Our "problem class" sessions
are pretty drop-in friendly.  You'll need:

• A scheme or racket repl (e.g. from a laptop)

• To read SICP, sec.2.2, or watch the lectures 

• To brush up on SICP Ch1 - know how to define functions, use lambdas
  and let, and know the difference between iteration and recursion. ]
