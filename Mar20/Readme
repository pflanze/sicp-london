Sec 2.4.3-2.5.1

We're starting the final stretch of the chapter on data abstraction
this week.

Change in format this week

I've included both background slides and source code for completing
this week's exercises.  We're focusing on a smaller section of the
book and taking more time to go through each problems.  Please read
Sec 2.4.3 and 2.5.1 *before* joining the study group.  Also take a
moment to run through the source code and background materials
included for this week.
