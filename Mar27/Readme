Sec 2.5.2-2.5.3

We're going deeper into data types this week with generic operations
on multiple types.  No background slides, but do see the source code
file (Slightly different from last week).

We start at 7pm - meet in the reception of the CSG building and I'll
come down to pick you up just after the top of the hour.  Bring a
laptop with a racket repl loaded with the source and we'll work on a
few problems in pairs for 2 hrs.
