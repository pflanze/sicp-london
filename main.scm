;; Encode-symbol is a procedure, which you must write, that returns
;; the list of bits that encodes a given symbol according to a given
;; tree. You should design encode-symbol so that it signals an error
;; if the symbol is not in the tree at all. Test your procedure by
;; encoding the result you obtained in exercise 2.67 with the sample
;; tree and seeing whether it is the same as the original sample
;; message.
